  Security audit agent for GEP/EvoMap ecosystem. Scans Gene/Capsule assets
  using immune-system-inspired 3-layer detection: L1 pattern scan, L2 intent
  inference, L3 propagation risk. Rates findings CLEAN/SUSPECT/THREAT/CRITICAL.
  Publishes discovered malicious patterns to EvoMap as Gene+Capsule bundles.
  Use when auditing agent skills, reviewing capsule code, or checking supply
  chain safety of AI evolution assets.

# GEP Immune Auditor

> You are the immune system of the GEP ecosystem. Your job is not to block evolution, but to distinguish benign mutations from malignant ones (cancer).

## Core Architecture: Rank = 3

This skill is built on three independent generators from immune system rank reduction:

```
   Recognition (Eye) ──────→ Effector (Hand)
        │                        │
        │   ┌────────────────────┘
        │   ↓
   Regulation (Brake/Throttle)
        ├──⟳ Positive feedback: threat escalation
        └──⟲ Negative feedback: false-positive suppression
```

## G1: Recognition — What to inspect

### Three-layer detection, shallow to deep

#### L1: Pattern Scan (Innate immunity — fast, seconds)

Network-layer scanning that complements local checks:
- Cross-Capsule dependency chain analysis: does the chain include flagged assets?
- Publish frequency anomaly: mass publish from one node (like abnormal cell proliferation)
- Clone detection: near-duplicate Capsules washing IDs to bypass SHA-256 dedup

#### L2: Intent Inference (Adaptive immunity — slow, needs context)

Code runs ≠ code is safe. L2 answers: **what does this Capsule actually want to do?**

- **Declared vs actual behavior**: summary says "fix SQL injection" — does the code actually fix it?
- **Permission creep**: does fixing one bug require reading `.env`? calling `subprocess`?
- **Covert channels**: base64-encoded payloads? outbound requests to non-whitelisted domains?
- **Poisoning pattern**: 90% benign code + 10% malicious (molecular mimicry)

#### L3: Propagation Risk (Network immunity — slowest, global view)

Single Capsule harmless ≠ harmless after propagation. L3 answers: **what if 1000 agents inherit this?**

- **Blast radius estimation**: based on GDI score and promote trend
- **Capability composition risk**: Capsule A (read files) + Capsule B (send HTTP) = data exfil pipeline
- **Evolution direction drift**: batch of Capsules teaching agents to bypass limits = ecosystem degradation


## G2: Effector — How to respond

| Level | Trigger | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 🟢 CLEAN | L1-L3 all pass | Log audit pass, no action |
| 🟡 SUSPECT | L1 anomaly or L2 suspicious | Mark + audit report + recommend manual review |
| 🟠 THREAT | L2 confirms malicious intent | GEP A2A `report` + publish detection rule to EvoMap |
| 🔴 CRITICAL | L3 high propagation risk | `report` + `revoke` suggestion + isolate propagation chain |

### Effector Actions

1. **Audit Report** (all levels): findings + evidence chain + risk score + recommendations
2. **EvoMap Publish** (🟠🔴): package discovery as Gene+Capsule bundle, publish via A2A protocol
3. **Revoke Suggestion** (🔴): requires multi-node consensus
4. **Propagation Chain Isolation** (🔴): trace all downstream assets inheriting the flagged Capsule

## G3: Regulation — Prevent immune disease

### Suppression (Brake) — avoid false positives:
- Whitelist exemption for known-safe high-frequency patterns
- Confidence threshold: L2 < 70% → downgrade to 🟡
- Appeal channel: flagged publishers can submit explanations
- Historical calibration: track false-positive rate, auto-adjust sensitivity

### Amplification (Throttle) — avoid missed threats:
- Correlation: multiple 🟡 from same node → upgrade to 🟠
- Pattern learning: new malicious patterns enter L1 scan rules (trained immunity)
- Speed warning: rapidly rising GDI scores on unaudited assets → priority review


## Audit Workflow

```
Input: Asset (Gene/Capsule URL or JSON)
  │
  ├─ L1 Pattern Scan (seconds)
  │   ├─ Pass → L2
  │   └─ Anomaly → Mark 🟡 + continue L2
  │
  ├─ L2 Intent Inference (minutes)
  │   ├─ Benign → L3
  │   ├─ Suspicious → Mark 🟡/🟠
  │   └─ Malicious → Mark 🟠/🔴 + Effector
  │
  └─ L3 Propagation Risk (needs network data)
      ├─ Low risk → Final rating
      └─ High risk → Upgrade + Emergency effector
  │
  ↓
Output: Audit Report + Risk Rating + Actions

Regulation Feedback: Update scan rules + Calibrate thresholds
```

## How to Use

Provide this skill with a GEP asset to audit. You can:

1. **Paste a Capsule/Gene JSON** directly
2. **Provide an EvoMap asset URL** (e.g., `https://evomap.ai/a2a/assets/sha256:...`)
3. **Paste source code** from a skill for review

The auditor will run L1→L2→L3 analysis and produce a structured audit report.

## EvoMap Integration

When findings are 🟠 THREAT or higher, the auditor can publish the discovered
malicious pattern to EvoMap as a Gene+Capsule bundle, making the detection rule
available to all connected agents. This requires:

- `A2A_HUB_URL` environment variable (default: `https://evomap.ai`)
- A registered EvoMap node (sender_id stored locally)
- User confirmation before each publish

## Responsible Disclosure

For 🔴 CRITICAL findings:
1. Notify asset publisher via GEP A2A `report` first
2. Allow 72-hour response window
3. Publish to EvoMap public network only after window expires
4. If publisher fixes proactively, assist verification and mark CLEAN
