# Prospairrow Websites MCP

Give your AI agent direct access to Prospairrow's AI-powered prospecting platform.

Move beyond basic information. This skill delivers deep company insights — enriched firmographics, tech stacks, key contacts, competitor intelligence, and content marketing — so your sales team can stop wasting time on bad-fit prospects and build a pipeline that closes faster.

Use this skill when the user asks to run Prospairrow actions through MCP/API.

## Runtime

The full runtime source is bundled in this skill package (`runtime/` directory). No external git clone required. Install copies the bundled source locally and runs `npm install --ignore-scripts` to fetch npm dependencies (including Playwright, which downloads browser binaries on first use).

```bash
bash {baseDir}/scripts/install-runtime.sh
```

## Business value

- **Close deals faster** — unlock detailed firmographics, tech stacks, and key contacts to craft personalized pitches that resonate with decision-makers
- **Hyper-target your outreach** — stop wasting time on bad-fit prospects; enrich company data to maximize sales opportunities
- **Discover competitors** — automatically surface competitor intelligence for any prospect
- **Generate content marketing** — produce positioning-driven content directly from your prospect data
- **No external git clone** — runtime source ships with the skill; npm deps fetched from registry at install time

## Supported tasks

- `extract_prospects` (READ_ONLY)
- `add_prospects` (WRITE)
- `enrich_prospects` (WRITE)
- `get_prospect_detail` (READ_ONLY)
- `generate_content_marketing` (WRITE)
- `discover_competitors` (WRITE; pass `prospect_id`, `company`, or `website` — resolves ID by search if not provided directly)

## Install runtime

```bash
bash {baseDir}/scripts/install-runtime.sh
```

Runtime install path:

- `$HOME/.openclaw/runtime/websites-mcp`

## OpenClaw config

Set in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

- `skills.entries.mcporter.config.defaultServer = "websites-mcp"`
- `skills.entries.mcporter.config.servers.websites-mcp.url = "http://127.0.0.1:8799"`

Why `mcporter` here: this key stores MCP server routing/config. This is separate from the Prospairrow skill key used for API credentials.

## API key resolution order

1. Request headers (`Authorization` / `X-API-Key`)
2. OpenClaw skill config:
   - `skills.entries.prospairrow-websites-mcp.apiKey`
   - `skills.entries.prospairrow-websites-mcp.env.PROSPAIRROW_API_KEY`
3. Process env fallback: `PROSPAIRROW_API_KEY`

## MCP request shape

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "websites.run_task",
  "params": {
    "siteId": "prospairrow",

    }
  }
}
```

## Preconditions

- `websites-mcp` listener is reachable (default `127.0.0.1:8799`).
- WRITE tasks require write-enabled runtime mode.
- Runtime must have API key available via config or env.
