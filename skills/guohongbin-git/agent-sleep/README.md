# 🛌 Agent Sleep System

> **Give your AI agent a circadian rhythm.** 
> Prevent context pollution, consolidate memories, and evolve over time.

## 🧠 The Problem

Agents that run 24/7 suffer from **"Brain Rot"** (context fragmentation).
- Daily logs pile up.
- Important insights get lost in noise.
- Workspace becomes cluttered.

## 💡 The Solution

**Agent Sleep** implements a biological-inspired sleep cycle:

1.  **Deep Sleep (Nightly)**: 
    - Reads yesterday's logs (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`).
    - **Compresses** them into semantic knowledge chunks (`.toon`).
    - **Updates** long-term memory (`MEMORY.md`).
    - **Archives** the raw logs to clear the workspace.
2.  **Micro-Rest**: 
    - Cleans up temporary files (`*.tmp`, `*.log`).

## 🛠️ Installation

### Via ClawHub (Coming Soon)
```bash
clawhub install agent-sleep
```

### Manual Install
1. Clone into your skills directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/guohongbin-git/agent-sleep.git ~/.openclaw/skills/agent-sleep
   ```
2. Ensure you have a `memory/` folder in your workspace.

## 🚀 Usage

### Manual Trigger
Tell your agent:
> "Run a sleep cycle."

Or run via CLI:
```bash
python3 src/run_sleep_cycle.py
```

### Automatic Schedule (Recommended)
Add this to your agent's **Cron** or **Heartbeat**:
```json
{
  "schedule": "0 3 * * *", // Run at 3 AM
  "command": "python3 ~/.openclaw/skills/agent-sleep/src/run_sleep_cycle.py"
}
```

## 🔌 Integration with Agent Library

If you have `agent-library` installed, Agent Sleep will automatically use its **Semantic Chunking** engine to convert your daily logs into high-quality knowledge crystals (`.toon` format).

Without it, it performs basic archival.
