## Funnel Psychology

### Psychological State by Stage

| Stage | User Mindset | Primary Need | Key Metrics |
|-------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Awareness** | Curious, skeptical | Relevance, credibility | Impressions, CTR |
| **Interest** | Engaged, evaluating | Understanding, value | Time on page, scroll |
| **Consideration** | Comparing, anxious | Trust, differentiation | Return visits, engagement |
| **Intent** | Ready, cautious | Risk reduction, clarity | Cart additions, form starts |
| **Conversion** | Committed, vulnerable | Confidence, simplicity | Completion rate |
| **Retention** | Satisfied/unsatisfied | Confirmation, support | NPS, churn, repeat |

### Friction Types

| Type | Description | Reduction Strategy |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Cognitive** | Thinking required | Simplify, chunk, default |
| **Emotional** | Fear, uncertainty | Social proof, guarantees |
| **Physical** | Actions required | Fewer steps, auto-fill |
| **Social** | Judgment concerns | Privacy, anonymity options |

### Micro-Conversions

Build momentum with small wins:

| Micro-Conversion | Psychological Purpose |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Email signup | Commitment, relationship start |
| Content download | Reciprocity, value exchange |
| Free trial start | Endowment, sunk cost |

## Landing Page Psychology

### Above-the-Fold Priorities

| Element | Purpose | Psychology |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **Headline** | Promise + relevance | Value proposition clarity |
| **Subhead** | Elaboration | Specificity builds trust |
| **Hero image** | Emotional connection | Visualization of outcome |
| **CTA** | Action clarity | Clear next step |
| **Social proof** | Trust signal | Reduce uncertainty |

### Visual Hierarchy

**Attention flow (F-pattern/Z-pattern):**
1. Headline (top-left)
2. Image (top-right or center)
3. Key benefits (scanning down-left)
4. CTA (prominent, repeated)

### Cognitive Fluency

Easy to process = perceived as better/truer:

| Element | Fluency Factor |
|---------|----------------|
| **Font** | Simple, readable (16px+ body) |
| **Contrast** | High contrast text |
| **White space** | Reduces cognitive load |
| **Language** | 6th-8th grade reading level |
| **Layout** | Predictable, conventional |

### Trust Builders

| Trust Element | Placement | Psychology |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| **Logos** | Below fold, above CTA | Authority, social proof |
| **Testimonials** | Throughout | Social proof, specificity |
| **Numbers** | Early | Credibility (specific > round) |
| **Guarantees** | Near CTA | Risk reversal |
| **Security badges** | Checkout | Safety assurance |

### Objection Handling

| Objection | Handling Strategy | Element |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| "Is this right for me?" | Specificity, segments | Persona targeting |
| "Will it work?" | Proof, results | Case studies, data |
| "Can I trust them?" | Credibility | Reviews, credentials |
| "Is it worth the price?" | Value framing | ROI, comparison |
| "What if it doesn't work?" | Risk reversal | Guarantee, refund |
| "Why now?" | Urgency (real) | Limited offer, consequences |

## Form Psychology

### Form Length Paradox

| Form Length | Effect | When to Use |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| **Short (1-3 fields)** | Higher completion | Low-commitment offers |
| **Medium (4-7 fields)** | Balanced | Qualified leads |
| **Long (8+ fields)** | Lower completion, higher quality | High-value offers |

### Field Optimization

| Principle | Description | Implementation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Minimal fields** | Only ask what's necessary | Remove or defer fields |
| **Logical order** | Match mental model | Name → email → details |
| **Single column** | Easier scanning | Avoid side-by-side fields |
| **Clear labels** | Reduce ambiguity | Above field, not inside |
| **Progressive disclosure** | Show relevant fields | Conditional logic |
| **Smart defaults** | Reduce decisions | Pre-fill when possible |

### Error Handling

| Practice | Psychology |
|----------|------------|
| Inline validation | Immediate feedback, flow |
| Constructive errors | Guidance, not blame |
| Preserve input | Respect user effort |
| Clear recovery | Path forward obvious |

### Multi-Step Forms

| Benefit | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Commitment | Foot-in-the-door, sunk cost |
| Progress visibility | Motivation, completion drive |
| Reduced overwhelm | Chunking, cognitive load |
| Qualification | Get easy info first |

**Progress indicators**: Show completion % or steps; increases completion 20-30%.

## Pricing Psychology

### Price Perception

| Technique | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Charm pricing** | End in 9 or 7 | $49 vs $50 |
| **Precise pricing** | Specific numbers | $247 vs $250 |
| **Anchoring** | Show higher first | ~~$500~~ $297 |
| **Decoy effect** | Make target option obvious | 3-tier with inferior middle |
| **Bundle** | Package value | "Everything you need" |
| **Per-unit** | Smaller numbers | "$1.50/day" vs "$45/month" |

### Price Presentation

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|---------------|
| **Font size** | Smaller price = less painful |
| **Currency** | Symbol reduces pain ($) vs spelled out |
| **Decimals** | Remove for premium feel |
| **Comparison** | Show what else costs same |
| **Value stack** | List everything included |

### Pricing Page Structure

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Social proof** | Pre-frame value |
| **3 tiers** | Choice architecture |
| **Recommended highlight** | Guide decision |
| **Feature comparison** | Clear differentiation |
| **FAQ** | Objection handling |
| **Guarantee** | Risk reversal |

### Decoy Pricing Example

```
Basic: $9/mo   │  Pro: $29/mo        │  Premium: $49/mo
5 features     │  15 features        │  All features
               │  ← Most Popular →   │
               │  (Clear best value) │
```

Make the target tier obviously superior to an inferior option.

| **First-person** | "Get Your Trial" | "Start My Free Trial" |
| **Specific** | "Continue" | "Continue to Checkout" |
| **Low commitment** | "Buy Now" | "Try Risk-Free" |

### CTA Design

| Element | Best Practice | Psychology |

| **Color** | Contrast with page | Visual pop, attention |
| **Size** | Large enough to notice | Importance signal |
| **Shape** | Rounded corners | Friendlier, approachable |
| **White space** | Breathing room around | Focus, clarity |
| **Position** | Multiple placements | Capture at different points |

### Reducing CTA Anxiety

|----------|---------|--------|
| **Primary** | Main conversion | Prominent, bold |
| **Secondary** | Alternative path | Outline, less prominent |
| **Tertiary** | Support actions | Text link |

## Experimentation Framework

### Hypothesis Structure

**If we [change X], then [metric Y] will [increase/decrease] because [psychology Z].**

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Change** | What you're testing | "Add social proof near CTA" |
| **Metric** | What you're measuring | "Click-through rate" |
| **Direction** | Expected effect | "Increase by 15%" |
| **Mechanism** | Why it should work | "Reduces purchase anxiety" |

### Prioritization Framework (PIE)

| Factor | Description | Score 1-10 |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Potential** | How much improvement possible | Impact size |
| **Importance** | How much traffic/value | Business value |
| **Ease** | How easy to implement | Development effort |

**Priority = (P + I + E) / 3**

### Test Types

| Type | Use Case | Requirements |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **A/B** | Single variable | Statistical significance |
| **Multivariate** | Multiple variables | High traffic |
| **Split URL** | Different pages | Separate URLs |
| **Personalization** | Segment targeting | Segment data |

### Statistical Considerations

| Factor | Guidance |
|--------|----------|
| **Sample size** | Calculate before test |
| **Duration** | Full business cycle (7+ days) |
| **Confidence** | 95% minimum |
| **Effect size** | Minimum detectable effect |
| **Segments** | Pre-define, don't p-hack |

### Common Testing Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Stopping early** | False positives | Pre-set duration |
| **Too many variants** | Diluted traffic | Max 3-4 variants |
| **Testing everything** | Noise | Prioritize high-impact |
| **Ignoring segments** | Hidden effects | Segment analysis |
| **No hypothesis** | No learning | Document reasoning |

### Learning Documentation

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Hypothesis** | What we believed |
| **Methodology** | How we tested |
| **Results** | What happened |
| **Insights** | What we learned |
| **Next steps** | What to test next |
