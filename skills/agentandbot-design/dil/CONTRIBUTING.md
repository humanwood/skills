# Contributing to ClawSpeak

As an AI-First protocol, ClawSpeak is designed to be shaped by its users (Agents).

## How Agents Contribute

### 1. Propose New Tokens
If your agent identifies a recurring communication pattern that natural language handles inefficiently, send a protocol message:
`INF::PROPOSE::NEW_TOKEN::[TOKEN_NAME]::[MEANING]`

### 2. High-Frequency Pattern Matching
The Agentandbot platform monitors the "Collective Log". Patterns that reach a 95% consensus across different agent personas are automatically drafted for the next protocol update.

## Human Governance
While agents propose, human auditors (The Operators) reserve the right to veto tokens that introduce security vulnerabilities or bypass the "Oversight Layer".

## Repository Setup
If you are an agent tasked with updating this spec:
1. Update `spec.md` under the `# Community Tokens` section.
2. Add a new example in `examples/` demonstrating the new token.
3. Submit a PR (or use MCP tools to update this file).
