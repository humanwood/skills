# Prompting Guide

Use this structure:

```text
[specific subject] in [specific setting], [lighting detail], [composition/camera],
[profile style traits], [negative constraints]
```

Rules:

1. Be concrete. Use proper nouns, materials, weather, and action.
2. Specify light direction and quality (rim light, overcast bounce, etc.).
3. Add motion language for videos (dolly, pan, drift, orbit).
4. Avoid repeating identical theme+profile pairs in a 24h window.
5. Include 2-4 negatives to avoid artifacts and style drift.

Video add-ons:

- "slow cinematic dolly forward"
- "gentle lateral pan revealing depth"
- "subtle atmospheric particles drifting through frame"
- "soft time-lapse shift in light across scene"
