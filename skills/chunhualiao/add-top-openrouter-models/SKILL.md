# OpenRouter Model Sync

Syncs models from the OpenClaw app leaderboard on OpenRouter into this openclaw installation.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Extract Model IDs via Browser

The app page is a React SPA -- must use browser tool, not web_fetch.

1. Open `https://openrouter.ai/apps?url=https%3A%2F%2Fopenclaw.ai%2F` in browser (profile: openclaw)
2. Take a snapshot, find and click "Show more" to expand full leaderboard
3. Take another snapshot after expansion
4. Extract model IDs from link hrefs -- they follow the pattern `/<provider>/<model-name>` (e.g. `/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`)
5. Filter out non-model links (navigation links to `/docs`, `/chat`, `/rankings`, `/pricing`, `/enterprise`, `/about`, etc.)
6. Collect the model IDs (without leading slash)

### Step 2: Run Sync Script

```bash
python3 scripts/sync-openrouter-models.py --models "model/id1,model/id2,..."
```

Options:
- `--dry-run` — preview changes without writing files
- `--json` — machine-readable JSON output on stdout
- stdin also accepted (one model ID per line)

The script:
1. Verifies each ID against the OpenRouter `/api/v1/models` catalog (rejects unverified)
2. Converts verified models to openclaw format (context window, pricing, reasoning, modalities)
3. Creates timestamped backups before writing any config file
4. Adds missing models to `~/.openclaw/agents/<agent>/agent/models.json` and `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
5. Generates aliases (from `references/aliases.json` or auto-derived)

### Step 3: Restart Gateway

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `OPENCLAW_DIR` | Override openclaw directory | `~/.openclaw` |
| `OPENCLAW_AGENT_DIR` | Override agent directory | auto-detected |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | API key (falls back to config) | from config |

## Maintaining Aliases

Edit `references/aliases.json` to add or update short aliases for model IDs. The script loads this file at runtime. If missing, built-in defaults are used.

## What Gets Updated

- `~/.openclaw/agents/main/agent/models.json` — openrouter provider models
- `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` — openrouter provider models + aliases
- Backups created as `<file>.bak.<timestamp>` before each write

## Limitations

- Additive only (does not remove delisted models)
- Reasoning detection uses heuristics (architecture field + known model families)
- Requires browser tool for Step 1 (app page is JS-rendered)
