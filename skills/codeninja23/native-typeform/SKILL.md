# Typeform

Read forms and responses directly via `api.typeform.com`.

## Setup (one-time)

1. Go to https://admin.typeform.com/account#/section/tokens
2. Click **Generate a new token**, give it a name, select scopes:
   - `Forms: Read`
   - `Responses: Read`
   - `Insights: Read`
3. Copy the token and set it:
   ```
   TYPEFORM_TOKEN=tfp_your_token_here
   ```

## Commands

### List your forms
```bash
python3 /mnt/skills/user/typeform/scripts/typeform.py list-forms
```

### Search forms by title
```bash
python3 /mnt/skills/user/typeform/scripts/typeform.py list-forms --search "customer survey"
```

### Get form definition (questions, logic, fields)
```bash
python3 /mnt/skills/user/typeform/scripts/typeform.py get-form <form_id>
```

### Get responses for a form
```bash
python3 /mnt/skills/user/typeform/scripts/typeform.py responses <form_id>
```

### Get last 100 responses
```bash
python3 /mnt/skills/user/typeform/scripts/typeform.py responses <form_id> --limit 100
```

### Filter responses by date range
```bash
python3 /mnt/skills/user/typeform/scripts/typeform.py responses <form_id> \
  --since 2026-01-01T00:00:00Z \
  --until 2026-02-01T00:00:00Z
```

### Get form insights (views, completions, completion rate)
```bash
python3 /mnt/skills/user/typeform/scripts/typeform.py insights <form_id>
```

### Get your account info
```bash
python3 /mnt/skills/user/typeform/scripts/typeform.py me
```

## Notes

- Free plan: 10 responses/month across all forms. API reads still work regardless.
- Rate limit: 2 requests/second.
- Form IDs look like `abc123XY` — find them in your Typeform dashboard URL or via `list-forms`.
- Webhooks require a PRO plan and are not supported by this skill.
