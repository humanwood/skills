[Address]

I'll cover shipping costs. Please confirm price and timeline.

Thank you.

Our current volume is [X units/month].

We're planning to increase to [Y units/month] and would like to 
discuss volume pricing.

Could you offer a discount for:
- 100+ units/order
- 500+ units/order
- 1000+ units/order

Looking forward to growing our partnership.
```

This affects [X]% of units in the order.

Please confirm:

## Backup Supplier Strategy

### For Each Top Product, Maintain:
1. **Primary supplier**: best combination of price, quality, speed
2. **Backup #1**: same product, different supplier, tested with samples
3. **Backup #2**: alternative product (similar function) if primary goes down

### Backup Activation Triggers

- Stock unavailable for >3 days
- Quality drops below acceptable threshold
- Shipping times increase >50%
- Price increases make margin unviable

### Monthly Supplier Health Check
- [ ] Primary supplier still responsive?
- [ ] Prices stable?
- [ ] Quality consistent? (check recent reviews)
- [ ] Shipping times stable?
- [ ] Backup suppliers still available?
- [ ] Any new suppliers worth evaluating?
