- Refund before dispute when appropriate

### Cash Flow Traps

| Risk | Prevention |
|------|------------|
| PayPal 90-day hold | Diversify processors. Don't depend only on PayPal |
| Negative cycle (pay supplier before receiving payment) | Maintain 3 months operating capital |
| Accumulated returns | Provision 10-15% for refunds in accounting |

### Real Margin Calculation

```
ACTUAL costs to include:
├── Product cost
├── Supplier shipping
├── Payment processor fees (3-4%)
├── Platform fees (if applicable): 5-15%
├── Advertising (CAC): varies widely
├── Returns/refunds (10-15%)
├── Chargebacks (1-2%)
├── Customer service: $0.50-2 per order
├── Software/apps
└── Taxes on profit

If margin < 15% after ALL costs → DANGER ZONE
```

| Ghost stock | 🟠 MEDIUM | Verify stock before promising delivery |

### Shipping

| Customs delays | Additional 2-4 weeks | Correct declaration, communicate proactively |

### Quality Control

| Risk | Prevention |

| 5-20% defect rate from AliExpress | Factor into margins, clear replacement policy |
| Toxic materials | Require CE, CPSC certifications. Don't sell children's products without verification |
| Product differs from photos | Use YOUR OWN photos, accurate descriptions with measurements |

## Reputational Risks

| Platform | Common Causes | Recovery |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Amazon | IP claims, metrics, restricted products | Plan of Action required, 50% don't recover |
| Shopify | Chargebacks, fraud, prohibited products | Clean record essential, if banned start fresh |

| Facebook Ads | Policy violations, negative feedback | Multiple Business Managers recommended |
