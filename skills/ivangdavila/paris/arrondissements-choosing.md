## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "16th is best" | Boring, far from action |
| "Montmartre = charming" | Tourist parts only; some areas rough |
| "Central = best" | Small apartments, noise, expensive |
| "Cheap = dangerous" | 13th, 14th, 15th are cheap AND safe |
| "1st for tourists" | Best to stay, maybe not live |

---

## For Short-Term Visitors

| Stay Duration | Best Areas |
|---------------|------------|
| **1-3 days** | 4th (Marais), 1st (Louvre) |
| **1 week** | 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th |
| **1 month** | 10th, 11th (local feel + affordable) |

---

## For New Residents

1. **Start in 10th or 11th** — affordable, central, young
2. **Explore for 3-6 months** — learn the city
3. **Move to your ideal** — once you know what you want
