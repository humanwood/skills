## Auto-Adaptive Writing Preferences

This skill auto-evolves. Edit sections below as you learn user's writing patterns.

**Rules:**
- Detect patterns from what user writes and edits
- Support multiple contexts (brands, people, content types)
- Confirm after 2+ consistent examples
- Keep entries ultra-compact
- Check `dimensions.md` for categories, `criteria.md` for format

---

### Default
<!-- General style when no specific context. Format: "trait" -->

### By Context
<!-- Different styles for different situations. Format: "context: traits" -->

### Voices
<!-- Named personas/brands with distinct styles. Format: "name: traits" -->

### Never
<!-- Things user rejected or dislikes in writing -->
