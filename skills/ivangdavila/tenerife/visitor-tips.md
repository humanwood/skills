## Common Mistakes

1. **Only staying south** — Missing the real Tenerife
2. **Not renting a car** — Public transport limits you
3. **Ignoring clouds** — North clouds often burn off; south gets wind
4. **Packing too light** — Teide is cold, north needs layers
5. **No reservations** — Teide cable car and Masca sell out
6. **Expecting Caribbean beaches** — Most beaches volcanic black (still beautiful)
7. **Rushing Teide** — It deserves a full day, not a quick stop
8. **Tourist trap restaurants** — Walk 2 blocks from main strip for better food
9. **Underestimating distances** — 50km can take 1.5 hours on mountain roads
10. **Skipping La Laguna** — Most beautiful town, often overlooked
