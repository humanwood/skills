# Los Cristianos & Las Américas — South Tourist Zone

## Overview

The heart of package tourism in Tenerife. Purpose-built from the 1960s onwards for sun-seeking Europeans.

- **Los Cristianos**: Original fishing village turned resort, more authentic feel
- **Playa de las Américas**: Purpose-built resort strip, nightlife central
- **Torviscas/Fañabé**: Bridge between Las Américas and Costa Adeje

Guaranteed sun, beaches, full tourist infrastructure, but lacks authenticity.

## For Digital Nomads

This is not the typical nomad zone. More retirees and package tourists than laptop workers.

### If You Insist
- **Coworking**: Limited; better options Costa Adeje
- **Cafes**: Most tourist-oriented, variable wifi
- **Community**: Not really nomad community here
- **Better option**: Base in El Médano or Costa Adeje

### Who This Suits
- Budget-conscious wanting south
- Those combining holiday/work
- Night owls who work afternoons
- Short stays only
