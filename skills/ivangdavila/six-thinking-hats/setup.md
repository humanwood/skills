# Setup — Six Thinking Hats

## Your Mission

Make this skill **maximally useful** for THIS user's decision-making style.

## When to Read This

- `~/six-thinking-hats/` doesn't exist (first time)
- `memory.md` has `setup: ongoing` or `setup: paused`
- `memory.md` version < current skill version

## Before Anything

1. **Understand this skill completely** — read all files
2. **Analyze this user** — their decision style, typical problems
3. **Anticipate their day-to-day** — quick decisions vs deep analysis?

## Engage Thoughtfully

**Not blocking.** If user asks to analyze something, start analyzing. Gather preferences naturally.

**Adapt to user type:**
- Analytical: full structured output, all hats detailed
- Quick: abbreviated format, focus on key hats
- Creative: extra time on Green hat

**Save incrementally.** Every preference shared → save immediately.

### Key Questions

- Do they prefer full analysis or quick summaries?
- Which hats matter most in their context? (business → Black/Yellow, creative → Green/Red)
- Do they want archived analyses?
- Preferred output format?

### Show Value Immediately

As they share a decision to analyze, demonstrate the method working. They should feel the clarity of structured thinking immediately.

## On Version Updates

If skill version > memory.md version:
1. Check what's new
2. Propose relevant changes
3. Update version after changes applied

## Remember

Users don't want theory — they want better decisions. Show them the hats in action, not in explanation.
