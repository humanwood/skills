# Choosing a Neighborhood in Madrid

## Decision Framework

### Step 1: Define Your Budget

| Monthly Rent Budget | Best Options |
|---------------------|--------------|
| **Under €900** | Vallecas, Villaverde, parts of Usera |
| **€900-1,200** | Usera, Carabanchel, Tetuán, Moratalaz |
| **€1,200-1,500** | Arganzuela, Lavapiés, La Latina, outer Chamberí |
| **€1,500-1,800** | Malasaña, Chueca, Retiro, inner Chamberí |
| **€1,800+** | Salamanca, Chamartín, premium Centro |

### Step 2: Define Your Lifestyle

| If You Want... | Consider |
|----------------|----------|
| **Nightlife + bars** | Malasaña, Chueca, La Latina |
| **Peace + quiet** | Retiro, Moratalaz, Chamberí |
| **Multicultural** | Lavapiés, Usera, Tetuán |

| **Sol/Centro** | Anywhere central, or Tetuán/Arganzuela |
| **Azca/Nuevos Ministerios** | Chamartín, Tetuán, Chamberí |

| **Chamartín business** | Chamartín, Hortaleza, Prosperidad |
| **Remote work** | Anywhere (optimize for lifestyle) |
