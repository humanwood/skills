# Criteria for Learning Preferences

Reference only — consult when updating SKILL.md.

## When to Add

**Immediate:**
- User explicitly states preference ("I learn better with examples first")
- User asks for different format ("can you quiz me instead?")
- User shows frustration with current approach
- User says "that clicked" after specific method

**After pattern (2+):**
- Consistently engages more with certain formats
- Asks follow-up questions after specific styles
- Retains better from certain approaches

## When NOT to Add
- Topic-specific (complex topic needed diagram, doesn't mean always)
- Time constraint ("just quick answer" when busy)
- One-off request

## How to Write Entries

**Preferences examples:**
- `examples before theory`
- `visual learner, prefers diagrams`
- `wants Socratic questioning`
- `prefers reading over video`
- `needs analogies to connect`

**Never examples:**
- `no long theory blocks`
- `skip mnemonics`
- `don't quiz, just explain`
- `no gamification`

## Detecting Preference Signals

- User applies concept correctly after certain explanation style
- User builds on explanation without confusion
- User says "got it" and moves on confidently
- Fewer clarifying questions after specific methods

## Maintenance
- Keep SKILL.md under 35 lines
- Group similar preferences
- Note what DOESN'T work in Never section
