# Motivation Reference

## Why People Quit

- Lack of visible progress
- Too hard too fast (frustration)
- Too easy (boredom)
- No clear "why"
- Life priorities compete
- Learning alone feels heavy
- Reward too distant

## Intrinsic vs Extrinsic

**Intrinsic** (curiosity, mastery, purpose)
- Sustains long-term
- Self-reinforcing

**Extrinsic** (badges, certificates)
- Can kickstart
- Often backfires long-term
- Overjustification effect: Adding rewards can KILL intrinsic motivation

**Best combo:** Intrinsic core + light extrinsic during tough stretches

## Flow States

Sweet spot: Challenge ~4% above current skill

**Requires:**
- Clear goals
- Immediate feedback
- Sense of control

**Enemies:**
- Interruptions
- Unclear instructions
- Anxiety

## Gamification

**Surface** (points, badges, streaks)
- Short-term boost
- Often hollow

**Deep** (meaningful choices, mastery paths)
- Actually works
- Reveals real progress

**The trap:** Game becomes the goal, not learning

## What AI Should Do

✅ Connect to learner's specific goals
✅ Make progress visible meaningfully
✅ Adjust difficulty dynamically
✅ Celebrate genuine milestones
✅ Create natural stopping points

❌ Guilt-trip about broken streaks
❌ Over-praise trivially
❌ Manufacture fake urgency
❌ Push when someone needs a break
❌ Assume one motivation style fits all

## Core Insight

AI role: Remove friction, illuminate progress, connect to purpose — then get out of the way.
