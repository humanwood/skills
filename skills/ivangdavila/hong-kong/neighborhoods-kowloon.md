# Kowloon: TST, Mong Kok & Beyond

## Overview

Across Victoria Harbour lies Kowloon-denser, grittier, more affordable, and arguably more authentically Hong Kong than the island. From the tourist mecca of Tsim Sha Tsui to the organized chaos of Mong Kok, Kowloon offers expats a different perspective on the city.
