> Last updated: February 2025

## The Absolute Must-See Attractions

### Victoria Peak
**Verdict: MUST DO** 

At 552m, Victoria Peak offers the most iconic Hong Kong views. Skip the overpriced Peak Tower shopping mall and head for the **Lugard Road loop trail** - a flat, accessible 3.4km path with panoramic viewpoints minus the crowds.

**Best times:**
- **Sunset** (arrive 30 min before) - See the transition from day to night skyline
- **Weekday mornings** - Fewer tourists, clearer air
- **Avoid:** Weekend afternoons, public holidays

**Getting there:**
- **Peak Tram**: HK$62 return (~$8 USD) - Steep, scenic, but LONG queues (30-60 min on weekends)
- **Bus 15** from Central Exchange Square: HK$12 (~$1.50 USD) - Same views, no queue
- **Hike from Pok Fu Lam Reservoir**: 1.5-2 hours, rewarding and free

**Pro tip:** Combine the hike up with Peak Tram down (one-way HK$52).

---

### Star Ferry
**Verdict: ESSENTIAL** 

The most iconic Hong Kong experience for HK$5 (~$0.65 USD). This 10-minute ride between Tsim Sha Tsui and Central has been running for 140+ years.

**Best times:**
- **8 PM** - Coincides with Symphony of Lights show
- **Sunset** - Golden hour magic on both skylines
- **Upper deck** costs HK$1 more but better views

**Routes:**
- TST  Central (most popular)
- TST  Wan Chai
- 1-hour Water Tour (HK$150) on vintage vessel

**Pro tip:** Sit on the right side (TSTCentral) for best skyline photos.

### Big Buddha & Po Lin Monastery ( / )
**Verdict: WORTH IT** 

The world's largest seated bronze Buddha at 34m tall. The setting in the mountains of Lantau Island is genuinely impressive.

**Best times:**
- **Early morning (before 10 AM)** - Peaceful, misty atmosphere
- **Weekdays** - Avoid weekend crowds

**Getting there:**
- **Ngong Ping 360 Cable Car**: HK$235 one-way (~$30 USD), HK$295 return
  - Crystal cabin (glass bottom): +HK$55
  - Skip the line: Buy tickets online in advance
- **Bus 23** from Tung Chung: HK$20 (~$2.50 USD) - Scenic mountain road

**Pro tip:** Take the cable car up, bus down (or vice versa) for variety.

---

### Temple Street Night Market
**Verdict: FUN EXPERIENCE** 

Classic Hong Kong night market atmosphere in Yau Ma Tei, Kowloon. Best for souvenirs, street food, and people-watching rather than quality shopping.

**Best times:**
- **7-10 PM** - Peak atmosphere
- Opens from 4 PM but gets lively after dark

**What to expect:**
- Souvenirs, electronics, clothes (bargain hard - start at 50% of asking price)
- Fortune tellers and opera singers
- Nearby dai pai dong (cooked food stalls)

**Skip:** The electronics - quality is questionable. Temple Street is for atmosphere, not serious shopping.

---

### Ding Ding Trams
**Verdict: MUST DO** 

Double-decker trams have been running since 1904. At HK$3.20 (~$0.40 USD), it's the cheapest sightseeing in the city.

**Best routes:**
- **Kennedy Town  North Point**: Full island traverse (1+ hour)
- Pass through **Chun Yeung Street Market** in North Point - tram literally squeezes through vegetable stalls!

**Pro tips:**
- Board at back, exit at front (pay with Octopus)
- Top deck, front seat = best experience
- Air-conditioned trams now available (same price)

## Hidden Gems (What Locals Know)

**Details:**
- **Free admission**
- Diamond Hill MTR, Exit C2
- Allow 2-3 hours

---

**Details:**
- **Free admission**, no signup needed
- Guided tours available via Water Supply Department website

Hippie vibes, car-free streets, craft beer shacks, and seafood restaurants. The ultimate escape from Hong Kong's intensity.

---

### PMQ
**Rating:** 

Former Police Married Quarters turned creative hub in Central. Local designers, boutiques, pop-ups, and markets.

**Details:**
- Hollywood Road, Sheung Wan
- Great for Hong Kong-made gifts
- Regular markets and events

---

### Cat Street & Sheung Wan Antiques
**Rating:** 

Vintage curios, antiques (and clever fakes), and Old Hong Kong atmosphere along Upper Lascar Row.

---

## Tourist Traps to Skip or Manage

###  Madame Tussauds (The Peak)
**Skip unless:** You LOVE wax museums. HK$350 (~$45 USD) for generic global celebrities plus a few local ones. Spend the money on food instead.

---

### ï The Peak Galleria / Peak Tower
**Manage expectations:** Overpriced mall with chain restaurants. Go for the view, skip the shopping. The Trick Eye Museum (HK$150) is only worth it if traveling with kids.

---

### ï Avenue of Stars
**Manage expectations:** Hong Kong's Hollywood Walk of Fame. Cheesy piped music, but the Bruce Lee statue and harbour views are worth a quick stop. Don't spend more than 30 minutes.

---

### ï Symphony of Lights
**Manage expectations:** Marketed as the world's "largest permanent light show" - it's basically colored lights on buildings. Watch from Star Ferry (free) rather than fighting crowds at TST waterfront.

---

###  Hong Kong Disneyland
**Skip unless:** You're traveling with kids or Disney obsessives. It's the smallest Disney park and nothing you can't get better elsewhere. HK$639 (~$82 USD) for adults.

---

### ï Ladies Market (Mong Kok)
**Manage expectations:** Mostly cheap clothes and fake goods. Can be fun for bargaining practice but don't expect quality. Temple Street has better atmosphere.
