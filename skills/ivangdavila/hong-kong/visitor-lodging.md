## The Airbnb Situation in Hong Kong

### Legal Status: **Complicated**

Hong Kong has strict regulations on short-term rentals. Technically:
- Rentals under 28 days require a hotel license
- Most Airbnbs operate in a **legal gray zone**
- Government occasionally cracks down

### What This Means for You:

**Availability:**
- Airbnbs exist but fewer than other major cities
- Many listings are actually licensed guesthouses
- Quality varies wildly

**Risks:**
- Booking might get cancelled
- Building security might deny entry
- No legal recourse if problems arise

**Recommendation:**
- **For short stays (1-7 nights):** Hotels are safer and often similar price
- **For longer stays (1+ month):** Serviced apartments or proper sublets
- **If using Airbnb:** Book Superhosts with many reviews

### Alternatives:

**Serviced Apartments (HK$15,000-40,000/month)**
- Legal, furnished, flexible terms
- Examples: Shama, CHI Residences, Ovolo

**Extended Stay Hotels**
- Weekly/monthly rates available
- Breakfast often included

## Booking Tips

### Best Booking Channels

| Platform | Best For | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Direct booking** | Loyalty programs, flexibility | Often price-matched |
| **Booking.com** | Mid-range comparison | Good cancellation policies |
| **Agoda** | Asian hotels, budget | Popular in HK |
| **Hotels.com** | Collecting nights | 10th night free |

### When Prices Spike

**High Season (Book 2-3 months ahead):**
- Chinese New Year (late Jan/Feb) - 50-100% higher
- Easter week
- October (autumn, best weather)
- Christmas/New Year

**Events:**
- Hong Kong Sevens (April) - TST sells out
- Art Basel (March)
- Major conferences

**Low Season (Better deals):**
- June-August (hot, humid, typhoons)
- November (except holidays)

### Room Size Reality Check

**Hong Kong hotel rooms are SMALL:**
- Budget: 8-12 sqm (86-129 sq ft)
- Mid-range: 15-22 sqm (161-237 sq ft)
- Luxury: 30-45 sqm (323-484 sq ft)

**For comparison:** Average US hotel room is ~35 sqm (375 sq ft)

If you need space, look for:
- "Family rooms" or suites
- Serviced apartments
- Budget up (luxury hotels have bigger base rooms)
