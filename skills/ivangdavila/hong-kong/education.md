# Hong Kong Education: A Parent's Guide

## Overview: Intense, Competitive, World-Class

Hong Kong's education system is famously rigorous. Students consistently rank among the world's best in PISA assessments. The flip side? Immense pressure, long hours, and a tutoring culture that borders on obsessive.

> **Reality check:** If you have school-age children, education will likely be your biggest decision (and possibly expense) in Hong Kong.

## Local Schools

### The System

Hong Kong follows a **6-3-3 structure:**
- Primary: 6 years (ages 6-12)
- Junior Secondary: 3 years (ages 12-15)
- Senior Secondary: 3 years (ages 15-18)

Education is **compulsory and free** through Form 3 (age 15), and effectively free through Form 6 for public schools.

### Medium of Instruction

**CMI (Chinese Medium of Instruction):** ~70-80% of schools
- Taught in Cantonese
- Chinese language subjects in Chinese, some subjects in English

**EMI (English Medium of Instruction):** ~20-30% of schools
- Taught primarily in English
- Considered "elite"-highly competitive admission
- Examples: Diocesan Boys' School, St. Paul's Co-educational College

### Curriculum & Exams

**Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (DSE):**
- Taken at end of Form 6 (equivalent to A-Levels/AP)
- High-stakes exam determining university admission
- Intense preparation starting from Form 4

### Can Expat Kids Attend Local Schools?

Technically yes, if they:
- Have Hong Kong residency
- Can handle Cantonese instruction (for CMI schools)
- Can navigate the competitive admission process

**Realistically:** Unless your children speak fluent Cantonese or you're committed to full integration, local schools are challenging for expat families.

## English Schools Foundation (ESF)

The **middle ground** between local and full international schools.

### What is ESF?

A network of 22 schools (including primary, secondary, and special education) established in 1967 to serve English-speaking families in Hong Kong.

1. Siblings of current students
2. Debenture holders
3. Children in catchment areas
4. Order of application

> **Expat tip:** Apply the moment you know you're moving. Years of waiting possible for popular schools.

## International Schools

The most common choice for expatriate families, especially those on corporate packages.

### Curriculum Options

| Curriculum | Schools Offering | Notes |

### Top-Tier International Schools

| School | Curriculum | Annual Fees (HK$) | Notes |
|--------|------------|------------------|-------|
| **Chinese International School** | IB | 200,000-280,000 | Bilingual English/Mandarin, very selective |
| **Hong Kong International School (HKIS)** | American | 200,000-250,000 | Strong US university placement |

### The Debenture Problem

Many international schools require **debentures** (essentially interest-free loans):

| Type | Amount (HK$) | Refundable? |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| Individual debenture | 500,000-8,000,000+ | Usually yes, upon leaving |
| Corporate debenture | 2,000,000-10,000,000+ | Held by company |
| No debenture | - | Higher fees instead |

**Top schools' debentures can trade for HK$10+ million** in secondary markets.

> **Corporate expat tip:** Get debenture commitment in your contract. This is a standard negotiating point for senior hires.

## The Tutoring Culture

Here's where Hong Kong education gets... intense.

### The Reality

- **~70%** of primary students use tutoring services
- **~85%+** of secondary students use tutors for exam preparation
- Tutoring industry worth **HK$20+ billion** annually
- "Star tutors" earn millions and have celebrity status

### Types of Tutoring

| Type | Cost (HK$/hour) | What It Is |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| **Tutorial centers** | 150-400 | Large classes, video-recorded lectures |
| **Small group** | 400-800 | 4-8 students |
| **Private tutors** | 500-2,000+ | One-on-one, often university students |
| **Star tutors** | 1,000-3,000 | Celebrity tutors, premium prices |

### What This Means for Expat Families

International school students are **not immune**. Many supplement with:
- IB preparation courses
- English/Mandarin enrichment
- Music/art for applications
- SAT/ACT prep (for US-bound students)

> **Honest take:** The tutoring culture reflects genuine academic pressure. You can opt out, but understand your child may feel behind peers who don't.
