## Tipping Culture - KEEP YOUR MONEY

| Hotel bellhop | HK$10-20 per bag (optional) |
| Hotel housekeeping | Not expected |
| Bars | Not expected |
| Haircuts | Not expected |

### Important Notes
- Check your bill - "Service Charge: 10%" means tip is included
- Leaving extra on top of service charge is NOT expected
- High-end Western restaurants may expect tips (follow Western norms)
- If there's NO service charge, small tip (5-10%) is appreciated but not required

## What NOT To Do

###  Don't Block Escalators
Stand on the RIGHT, walk on the LEFT. This is SERIOUS BUSINESS.

###  Don't Eat on MTR
No food or drinks on trains. HK$2,000 fine.

###  Don't Jaywalk
Fines up to HK$2,000. Use pedestrian crossings.

###  Don't Expect Personal Space
Hong Kong is CROWDED. People will push, jostle, and squeeze. It's not rude, it's survival.

###  Don't Use Taxis for Short Distances
MTR is faster. Taxis get stuck in traffic and are expensive compared to public transport.

###  Don't Carry Large Bills Only
Many small shops, taxis, and vendors can't break HK$500 or HK$1000. Carry smaller denominations.

###  Don't Expect English Everywhere
Central, TST, and tourist areas = English OK. 
Mong Kok, local neighborhoods = Less English. Google Translate helps.

###  Don't Skip the Octopus Card
Cash is accepted but MUCH less convenient. Get the card first thing.

###  Don't Schedule Tight Connections
Traffic jams happen. MTR delays happen. Leave buffer time.

###  Don't Forget to Look Up
Hong Kong's best views are UP - rooftops, skyscrapers, the Peak. And DOWN - underground malls, MTR connections stretch forever.
