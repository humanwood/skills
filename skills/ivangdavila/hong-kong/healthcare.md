# Hong Kong Healthcare: An Expat Guide

## Overview: World-Class, Dual-Track System

Hong Kong has one of the world's best healthcare systems-ranked among the top globally for life expectancy and infant survival. The system operates as a **dual-track model**: public (heavily subsidized) and private (pay-or-insure).

> **Bottom line:** Healthcare quality is excellent. The question is access, wait times, and whether your employer provides insurance.

## Public vs. Private: The Core Decision

| Factor | Public | Private |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Cost** | Heavily subsidized (HK$100-400 per visit) | Full price or insurance |
| **Wait times** | Long (weeks to months for specialists) | Same-day to days |
| **Quality of care** | Excellent (same doctors often work both) | Excellent |
| **Facilities** | Functional, older | Modern, hotel-like |
| **Language** | Cantonese primary | English typically available |
| **Who uses it** | Locals, budget-conscious expats | Expats with insurance, locals who can afford it |

### Who Qualifies for Public Healthcare?

- Holders of **Hong Kong ID cards** (residents)
- Resident children under 11
- Not available for tourists or short-term visitors

If you have a HKID, you're eligible for subsidized public healthcare regardless of nationality.

## The Public System (Hospital Authority)

The **Hospital Authority** manages 43 public hospitals and 74 clinics across Hong Kong. It's funded primarily by the government and delivers ~88% of inpatient services.

### How It Works

1. **General Outpatient Clinics (GOPC):** For non-urgent primary care. Book ahead-walk-ins face long waits.
2. **Specialist Outpatient Clinics (SOPC):** Referral required from GOPC. Waiting times can be 6-24+ months.
3. **Accident & Emergency (A&E):** For emergencies. HK$400 per visit (since January 2026).

### Costs (Public)

| Service | Cost (HK$) | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| A&E visit | 400 | Increased from 180 in 2026 |
| General outpatient | 50 | Per visit |
| Specialist outpatient | 135 | First visit |
| Specialist follow-up | 80 | Per visit |
| Hospitalization | 120/day | Includes everything |
| Surgery | Included | No separate charge |

**Reality check:** These prices are astonishingly cheap by global standards. A routine hospitalization that would cost US$50,000+ in America costs a few hundred HKD here.

### Wait Time Reality

This is where public healthcare disappoints:

- **Specialist referrals:** 6 months to 2+ years depending on specialty
- **Non-urgent surgery:** Can be 1-3 years
- **A&E for non-emergencies:** 4-8 hours typical (they triage aggressively)

> **Expat experience:** Public healthcare is amazing for emergencies and acute conditions. For anything chronic or non-urgent, you'll want private access.

## The Private System

12 private hospitals plus numerous private clinics offer premium, fast-access care.

### Major Private Hospitals

| Hospital | Location | Known For | Notes |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Matilda International** | The Peak | Expat-friendly, maternity | Beautiful location, high-end |
| **Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital** | Happy Valley | Comprehensive, cancer | Premium pricing |
| **Canossa Hospital** | Mid-Levels | General, maternity | Catholic mission hospital |
| **Hong Kong Adventist Hospital** | Multiple | General care | Good quality, mid-range |
| **St. Paul's Hospital** | Causeway Bay | Maternity, pediatrics | Popular with expats |
| **Union Hospital** | Tai Wai | General | New Territories option |
| **Gleneagles Hong Kong** | Wong Chuk Hang | Multi-specialty | Newer, modern facilities |

### Private Costs (Without Insurance)

Brace yourself:

| Service | Cost (HK$) | USD Equivalent |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| GP consultation | 400-800 | $50-100 |
| Specialist consultation | 1,000-3,000 | $130-385 |
| Basic health screening | 3,000-8,000 | $385-1,000 |
| MRI scan | 8,000-15,000 | $1,000-1,900 |
| Normal delivery | 60,000-120,000 | $7,700-15,400 |
| C-section delivery | 100,000-200,000 | $12,800-25,700 |
| Minor surgery | 50,000-150,000 | $6,400-19,200 |
| Major surgery | 200,000-500,000+ | $25,700-64,000+ |

**No insurance? No problem (sort of):** Private hospitals require payment upfront or guaranteed insurance. If uninsured, bring a credit card with high limits.

## Health Insurance

### Employer-Provided Insurance

Most professional expat packages include health insurance. This is the norm-if your offer doesn't include it, negotiate.

**What good employer coverage includes:**
- Private hospital access
- Outpatient consultations
- Dental and vision (sometimes)
- Maternity (check waiting periods)
- Emergency evacuation

**Watch out for:**
- Pre-existing condition exclusions
- Waiting periods (especially maternity: 10-12 months typical)
- Coverage limits (some plans have low annual caps)
- Network restrictions

### Buying Your Own Insurance

If self-employed or your employer doesn't provide coverage:

**Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme (VHIS):**
- Government-regulated standard plans
- Tax-deductible premiums (up to HK$8,000/year)
- Minimum coverage standards guaranteed
- Good baseline, but limited for comprehensive coverage

**Major private insurers:**
- AIA, AXA, BUPA, Cigna, Manulife
- Plans range from HK$5,000 to HK$50,000+ annually
- International vs. local coverage options

**Budget tip:** Consider a high-deductible plan covering hospitalization only, then pay out-of-pocket for routine care. Public system handles emergencies well.

## Pharmacies & Medications

### Prescription Medications

- **Registered pharmacies** (look for "Rx" symbol) can fill prescriptions
- Many medications available over-the-counter that require prescriptions elsewhere
- Common antibiotics, some steroids, basic medications sold without prescription
- **Controlled substances:** Strictly regulated, prescription required

### Chain Pharmacies

| Chain | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **Watsons** | Ubiquitous, cosmetics + pharmacy |
| **Mannings** | Similar to Watsons, slightly cheaper |
| **FANDA** | Prescription-focused, more traditional |

### Medication Costs

Generally affordable compared to the US, but not as cheap as mainland China:

- Common OTC medications: HK$30-100
- Antibiotics: HK$100-300
- Chronic disease medications: Varies widely

> **Tip:** If you take regular medications, check availability before moving. Some brand names differ; some medications unavailable.

## Special Considerations for Expats

### Language in Healthcare

**Public system:** Cantonese-dominant. Doctors trained in English medical terminology, but consultations may be challenging without Cantonese.

**Private system:** English widely available, especially in expat-popular hospitals. Specify English preference when booking.

### Mental Health

Historically stigmatized, but improving:

- **Public:** Long waits, limited English services
- **Private:** International therapists available (HK$1,500-3,000/hour)
- **Online options:** Growing, especially post-COVID
- **Community resources:** The Samaritans Hong Kong (English hotline), Mind HK

### Dental Care

Mostly private:

- **Check-up + cleaning:** HK$400-1,000
- **Filling:** HK$500-2,000
- **Crown:** HK$5,000-15,000
- **Root canal:** HK$6,000-12,000

Many expats combine dental work with travel to Thailand or mainland China for major procedures.

### Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)

Regulated and legitimate option:

- 7,400+ registered TCM practitioners
- Available in both public and private settings
- Acupuncture, herbal medicine, cupping common
- Some insurance plans cover it

---

## Emergency Situations

### Emergency Numbers

- **999:** Ambulance, fire, police (one number for all)
- **992:** For speech/hearing impaired

### What to Do

1. **True emergency:** Call 999 or go to nearest public hospital A&E
2. **Urgent but stable:** Private hospital A&E (faster, more expensive)
3. **After-hours non-emergency:** Many private clinics offer evening/weekend hours

### Ambulance Services

- **Public ambulances:** Free, go to nearest public hospital
- **Private ambulances:** Available, expensive (HK$5,000+)

---

## Health Screening

Regular check-ups are wise in Hong Kong (pollution, stress, work-life imbalance):

### Popular Check-Up Packages

| Level | Includes | Cost (HK$) |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Basic | Blood tests, urinalysis, basic physical | 1,500-3,000 |
| Standard | + ECG, chest X-ray, liver/kidney function | 3,000-6,000 |
| Comprehensive | + Ultrasound, cancer markers, bone density | 6,000-15,000 |
| Executive | Full imaging, stress test, consultations | 15,000-30,000+ |

---

## The Bottom Line: Strategies by Situation

### Employed Expat (with insurance)
- Use private system for convenience
- Check coverage limits annually
- Verify maternity coverage early if planning family

### Self-Employed/Entrepreneur

## Key Takeaways

1. **Quality is excellent:** Both systems deliver world-class care
2. **Access differs:** Private = fast; Public = cheap but slow
