## Step 1: Define Your Non-Negotiables

Ask yourself these critical questions:

### Commute Tolerance
- **Under 15 min:** Central, Admiralty, Sheung Wan, Wan Chai
- **15-30 min:** Causeway Bay, TST, Mong Kok, Tsuen Wan
- **30-45 min:** Sha Tin, Tai Po, Discovery Bay
- **45+ min acceptable:** Tuen Mun, Ma On Shan, remote NT

### Space Requirements
- **Studio/1BR sufficient:** Urban core viable
- **Need 2-3BR:** Consider Kowloon or New Territories
- **Need 4BR+ or house:** New Territories, Discovery Bay, or Mid-Levels ($$$$)

### School Proximity
- **ESF or international school:** Check specific campus locations
- **Harrow/other premium:** Tuen Mun, specific locations
- **Less critical:** More flexibility

## Step 2: Budget Reality Check

### Monthly Rent Brackets (1 Bedroom)

| Budget (HKD) | Budget (USD) | Options |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| Under 12,000 | Under $1,500 | Mong Kok, Yau Ma Tei, Tuen Mun |
| 12-18,000 | $1,500-2,300 | Jordan, Sha Tin, Tsuen Wan |
| 18-25,000 | $2,300-3,200 | Wan Chai, Causeway Bay, TST |
| 25-35,000 | $3,200-4,500 | Sheung Wan, Central edge |
| 35,000+ | $4,500+ | Central, Mid-Levels, Peak |

### The 30% Rule
Hong Kong expats often spend **40-50%** of income on rent (vs. the traditional 30% advice). Factor this reality into your planning.

### Hidden Costs
- **Utilities:** HKD 1,200-2,500/month (AC in summer is essential)
- **Management fees:** Often included, sometimes separate
