# New Territories: Suburban & Nature Living

## Overview

The New Territories make up 86% of Hong Kong's land area but hold only about half its population. For expats, this means **larger apartments**, **lower rents**, **nature access**, and **family-friendly environments**-at the cost of longer commutes. Post-2020, remote work has made these areas increasingly attractive.
