## Living Tips for Centrum Areas

### Finding Housing
1. **Register with multiple agencies** - Pararius, Funda, VBO
2. **Be ready to act fast** - viewings book within hours
3. **Prepare documents** - income proof, employment contract, ID
4. **Expect competition** - 50-100+ applicants per listing
5. **Consider sublets** - often easier entry point

### Surviving Tourist Crowds
- Shop early morning (before 10am)
- Use back streets instead of main thoroughfares
- Avoid weekend afternoons in summer
- Find "local" cafes away from tourist routes
- Embrace or accept-you live in a global attraction

### Noise Management
- Check building before signing-old buildings = poor insulation
- Ask about Airbnb/vacation rentals in building
- Invest in good earplugs and white noise
- Ground floor = street noise; top floor = stairs

### Practical Considerations
| Service | Availability |
|---------|--------------|
| Supermarkets | Albert Heijn, Jumbo (small format) |
| Gyms | Basic Fit, Vondelgym, boutique studios |
| Healthcare | Multiple huisartsen, OLVG nearby |
| International schools | Few in center-most in Zuid |
| Parking | Near impossible-EUR 500+/month if available |
