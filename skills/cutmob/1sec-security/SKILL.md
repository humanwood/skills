# 1-SEC Security Platform — Agent Skill

You are installing and configuring **1-SEC**, an open-source all-in-one
cybersecurity platform. One binary, 16 defense modules, zero config required.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to "secure this server" or "install security monitoring"
- User wants intrusion detection, WAF, LLM firewall, or ransomware protection
- User is deploying an AI agent (OpenClaw, Manus, Moltbot, etc.) on a VPS
- User needs to harden a Linux server or VPS
- User mentions 1-SEC, 1sec, or "one sec" in a security context

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://1-sec.dev/get | sh
```

This detects OS/arch, downloads the latest release, and installs to
`/usr/local/bin` (or `~/.local/bin` without root).

## Post-Install Setup

### Option A: Non-interactive (recommended for agents)

```bash
# Install + configure in one shot
1sec setup --non-interactive

# Start with all 16 modules, zero config
1sec up
```

### Option B: AI agent VPS deployment

If this server hosts an AI agent, use the purpose-built `vps-agent` preset.
This preset enables escalation timers (auto-escalates unacknowledged alerts),
disables approval gates (no human to approve), and marks critical actions
with `skip_approval` for immediate response:

```bash
# Install
curl -fsSL https://1-sec.dev/get | sh

# Non-interactive setup (uses env vars for AI keys)
1sec setup --non-interactive

# Apply the vps-agent enforcement preset (start in dry-run)
1sec enforce preset vps-agent --dry-run

# Start the engine
1sec up

# Configure notifications (pick your platform)
# Slack:
1sec config set webhook-url https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK --template slack
# Discord:
1sec config set webhook-url https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR/WEBHOOK --template discord
# Telegram:
1sec config set webhook-url https://api.telegram.org/botTOKEN/sendMessage --template telegram --param chat_id=CHAT_ID
```

### Option C: Interactive setup

```bash
1sec setup
```

Walks through config creation, AI key setup, and API authentication.

## Enforcement Presets

1-SEC ships with `dry_run: true` and the `safe` preset by default.

| Preset      | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| `lax`       | Log + webhook only. Never blocks or kills. |
| `safe`      | Default. Blocks only brute force + port scans at CRITICAL. |
| `balanced`  | Blocks IPs on HIGH, kills processes on CRITICAL. |
| `strict`    | Aggressive enforcement on MEDIUM+. |
| `vps-agent` | Purpose-built for AI agent hosts. Aggressive on auth, LLM firewall, containment, runtime, supply chain. |

Recommended progression: `lax` → `safe` → `balanced` → `strict`

The `vps-agent` preset is standalone — use it for AI agent deployments.

```bash
# Apply a preset
1sec enforce preset balanced

# Preview what a preset does without applying
1sec enforce preset strict --show

# Apply with dry-run safety net
1sec enforce preset balanced --dry-run
```

## Essential Commands

```bash
1sec up                        # Start engine (all 16 modules)
1sec status                    # Engine status
1sec alerts                    # Recent alerts
1sec alerts --severity HIGH    # Filter by severity
1sec modules                   # List all modules
1sec dashboard                 # Real-time TUI dashboard
1sec check                     # Pre-flight diagnostics
1sec doctor                    # Health check with fix suggestions
1sec stop                      # Graceful shutdown
```

## Enforcement Management

```bash
1sec enforce status            # Enforcement engine status
1sec enforce policies          # List response policies
1sec enforce history           # Action execution history
1sec enforce dry-run off       # Go live (disable dry-run)
1sec enforce test <module>     # Simulate alert, preview actions
1sec enforce approvals pending # Pending human approval gates
1sec enforce escalations       # Escalation timer stats
1sec enforce batching          # Alert batcher stats
1sec enforce chains list       # Action chain definitions
```

## AI Analysis (Optional)

The 15 rule-based modules work without any API key. For AI-powered
cross-module correlation, set a Gemini API key:

```bash
# Via environment variable
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
1sec up

# Or via CLI
1sec config set-key AIzaSy...

# Multiple keys for load balancing
1sec config set-key key1 key2 key3
```

## Configuration

Zero-config works out of the box. For customization, generate a config:

```bash
1sec init                      # Generate 1sec.yaml
1sec config --validate         # Validate config
```

Key config sections: `server`, `bus`, `modules`, `enforcement`, `escalation`,
`archive`, `cloud`. See `references/config-reference.md` for details.

## Webhook Notifications

Configure webhook URLs for alert notifications to Slack, Discord, Telegram,
PagerDuty, or Microsoft Teams:

```yaml
# In 1sec.yaml or configs/default.yaml
alerts:
  webhook_urls:
    - "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL"

# Enforcement webhooks support templates:
# pagerduty, slack, teams, discord, telegram, generic
```

Telegram example:

```yaml
enforcement:
  policies:
    auth_fortress:
      actions:
        - action: webhook
          params:
            url: "https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_TOKEN/sendMessage"
            template: "telegram"
            chat_id: "-1001234567890"
```

## Docker Deployment

```bash
cd deploy/docker
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f
```

## Day-to-Day Operations (Post-Install)

Once 1-SEC is running, the key commands for daily operations:

```bash
1sec status                    # Quick health check
1sec alerts                    # Recent alerts
1sec alerts --severity HIGH    # Filter by severity
1sec enforce status            # Enforcement engine state
1sec enforce history           # What actions were taken
1sec threats --blocked         # Currently blocked IPs
1sec doctor                    # Health check with fix suggestions
```
