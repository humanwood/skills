# Trademark Policy

Agent Holdings LLC owns the "Agent Passport" name and logo (the "Marks"). This policy explains what you can do with them and what requires written permission.

The code in this repository is licensed under MIT with Commons Clause (see LICENSE). That license governs the software. This document governs the Marks. They are separate.

## What you can do without asking

**Use the name to refer to the software.** Saying "we use Agent Passport" or "built on Agent Passport" is fine. Describing what Agent Passport does is fine. Writing blog posts, tutorials, or documentation that mention Agent Passport by name is fine.

**Fork and modify the code.** You can fork this repository, make changes, and distribute your version under the LICENSE terms. Your fork must use a different name. It cannot be called "Agent Passport," "Agent Passport Pro," "Agent Passport Cloud," or any variation that could be confused with the original.

**Build products that use Agent Passport.** If you integrate Agent Passport into your product for consent-gating or security purposes, you can say your product "uses Agent Passport" or "powered by Agent Passport" for non-commercial use. Commercial use of this integration requires a license (see below).

**Contribute to this repository.** Pull requests, bug reports, and documentation improvements are welcome. Your contributions remain under this project's license.
